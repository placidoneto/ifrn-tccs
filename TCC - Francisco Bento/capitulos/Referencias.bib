It includes functionality ranging from simple mapping to exploratory data analysis, the visualization of global and local spatial autocorrelation, and spatial regression. A key feature of GeoDa is an interactive environment that combines maps with statistical graphics, using the technology of dynamically linked windows. A brief review of the software design is given, as well as some illustrative examples that highlight distinctive features of the program in applications dealing with public health, economic development, real estate analysis, and criminology.}

Identification of spatial outliers can lead to the discovery of unexpected, interesting, and implicit knowledge, such as local instability. In this paper, we first provide a general definition of S-outliers for spatial outliers. This definition subsumes the traditional definitions of spatial outliers. Second, we characterize the computation structure of spatial outlier detection methods and present scalable algorithms. Third, we provide a cost model of the proposed algorithms. Finally, we experimentally evaluate our algorithms using a Minneapolis-St. Paul (Twin Cities) traffic data set.",

Using mean-shift and variance-weight models respectively, test statistics for multiple outliers are derived and the detecting procedures are proposed. In addition, several key diagnostic measures such as standardized residuals and leverage measure are defined in general spatial models. Outlier modified models are proposed to accommodate outliers in the data set. The performance of test statistics, including size and power, are examined via simulation studies. Three real examples are analyzed and the results show that the proposed methodology is useful for identifying and accommodating outliers in general spatial models.",

abstract="For many KDD applications finding the outliers, i.e. the rare events, is more interesting and useful than finding the common cases, e.g. detecting criminal activities in E-commerce. Being an outlier, however, is not just a binary property. Instead, it is a property that applies to a certain degree to each object in a data set, depending on how `isolated' this object is, with respect to the surrounding clustering structure. In this paper, we formally introduce a new notion of outliers which bases outlier detection on the same theoretical foundation as density-based cluster analysis. Our notion of an outlier is `local' in the sense that the outlier-degree of an object is determined by taking into account the clustering structure in a bounded neighborhood of the object. We demonstrate that this notion of an outlier is more appropriate for detecting different types of outliers than previous approaches, and we also present an algorithm for finding them. Furthermore, we show that by combining the outlier detection with a density-based method to analyze the clustering structure, we can get the outliers almost for free if we already want to perform a cluster analysis on a data set.",

abstract="This paper deals with finding outliers (exceptions) in large, multidimensional datasets. The identification of outliers can lead to the discovery of truly unexpected knowledge in areas such as electronic commerce, credit card fraud, and even the analysis of performance statistics of professional athletes. Existing methods that we have seen for finding outliers can only deal efficiently with two dimensions/attributes of a dataset. In this paper, we study the notion of DB (distance-based) outliers. Specifically, we show that (i) outlier detection can be done efficiently for large datasets, and for k-dimensional datasets with large values of k (e.g.,                   {\$}k {\backslash}ge 5{\$}                ); and (ii), outlier detection is a meaningful and important knowledge discovery task.",

	abstract="In this paper we propose a new definition of distance-based outlier that considers for each point the sum of the distances from its k nearest neighbors, called weight. Outliers are those points having the largest values of weight. In order to compute these weights, we find the k nearest neighbors of each point in a fast and efficient way by linearizing the search space through the Hilbert space filling curve. The algorithm consists of two phases, the first provides an approximated solution, within a small factor, after executing at most d + 1 scans of the data set with a low time complexity cost, where d is the number of dimensions of the data set. During each scan the number of points candidate to belong to the solution set is sensibly reduced. The second phase returns the exact solution by doing a single scan which examines further a little fraction of the data set. Experimental results show that the algorithm always finds the exact solution during the first phase after d- 《 d + 1 steps and it scales linearly both in the dimensionality and the size of the data set.",

The algorithm is based on the principle that an arc joiningX andP will cross the border ofS an odd number of times ifP lies outsideS, and an even number of times ifP lies withinS. The algorithm has been implemented as a set of FORTRAN subroutines, and a listing is provided. The algorithm and subroutine package can be used with spherical polygons containing holes, or with composited spherical polygons.",

Such a region should represent the location or configuration of the points as an aggregate, abstracting away from the individual points themselves. In this paper, we call such a region a `footprint' for the points. We investigate and compare a number of methods for producing such footprints, with respect to nine general criteria. The discussion identifies a number of potential choices and avenues for further research. Finally, we contrast the related research already conducted in this area, highlighting differences between these existing constructs and our `footprints'.",

The depth contours form a nested collection of convex sets. The deeper the contour, the more robust it is with respect to outliers in the point cloud. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in a program called ISODEPTH, which needs little computation time and is illustrated on some real data examples. Finally, it is shown how depth contours can be used to construct robustified versions of classification techniques based on convex hulls."

This paper aims to provide an overview of recent work in different aspects of data cleaning: error detection methods, data repairing algorithms, and a generalized data cleaning system.

abstract={Outlier is defined as an observation that deviates too much from other observations. The identification of outliers can lead to the discovery of useful and meaningful knowledge. Outlier detection has been extensively studied in the past decades. However, most existing research focuses on the algorithm based on special background, compared with outlier detection approach is still rare. This paper mainly discusses and compares approach of different outlier detection from data mining perspective, which can be categorized into two categories: classic outlier approach and spatial outlier approach. The classic outlier approach analyzes outlier based on transaction dataset, which can be grouped into statistical-based approach, distance-based approach, deviation-based approach, density-based approach. The spatial outlier approach analyzes outlier based on spatial dataset that non-spatial and spatial data are significantly different from transaction data, which can be grouped into space-based approach and graph-based approach. Finally, the paper concludes some advances in outlier detection recently.},

  abstract={Geospatial data, as a significant portion of big data, has recently gained the full attention of researchers. However, few researchers focus on the evolution of geospatial data and its scientific research methodologies. When entering into the big data era, fully understanding the changing research paradigm associated with geospatial data will definitely benefit future research on big data. In this paper, we look deep into these issues by examining the components and features of geospatial big data, reviewing relevant scientific research methodologies, and examining the evolving pattern of geospatial data in the scope of the four ‘science paradigms’. This paper proposes that geospatial big data has significantly shifted the scientific research methodology from ‘hypothesis to data’ to ‘data to questions’ and it is important to explore the generality of growing geospatial data ‘from bottom to top’. Particularly, four research areas that mostly reflect data-driven geospatial research are proposed: spatial correlation, spatial analytics, spatial visualization, and scientific knowledge discovery. It is also pointed out that privacy and quality issues of geospatial data may require more attention in the future. Also, some challenges and thoughts are raised for future discussion.}
